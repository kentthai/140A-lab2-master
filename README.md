# ECE140A Lab 2: Self-driving car with collision avoidance and path following


Due: 27 January 2020 11:15 PM (Monday Lab session)  
29 January 2020 11:15 PM (Wednesday Lab session)  
31 January 2020 11:15 PM (Friday Lab session)  

## High-level Objective
To enable the JetBot to move around autonomously. It should be able to follow a given path and avoid obstacles.

## Overview

In this lab we will:
1. Make a small dataset for collision avoidance.
2. Understand deep learning and PyTorch at a high level.
3. Write and train our deep learning model for collision avoidance.
4. Make a dataset for path following.
5. Write and train our deep learning model for path following.

## Directions

1. Download [the weights file](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1X2tp1cmwY9IUsheLMFsAgVB1vNP5-wnc/view?usp=sharing) and place it in the root folder of this repo.
2. Move the repo to the JetBot.
3. Open the `ECE140A Lab 2 - Part 1.ipynb` Jupyter notebook and follow the instructions.
4. Open the `ECE140A Lab 2 - Part 2.ipynb` Jupyter notebook and follow the instructions.

## Submission Details
 
Complete the two Jupyter notebooks, and export them as PDF in the same repository. Commit and push your repository. Upload a video to YouTube with your JetBot moving around in an environment with obstacles. Collision avoidance should be clearly demonstrated. Upload another video to YouTube demonstarting road following. Paste the links to both those videos in a markdown cell at the end of the Jupyter notebooks.

On Gradescope, make a GitHub link group submission for Lab 2. 

### Notes 

1. Only one GitHub repo and one Gradescope submission per group.
2. Make sure that your uploaded videos are **Unlisted**.
